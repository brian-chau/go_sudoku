## Sudoku solver written in Go

I lifted this code from a Leetcode solution, which can be found here: https://leetcode.com/problems/sudoku-solver/discuss/1586117/Go-Solution%3A-4-ms-(86.32)-2.6-MB-(11.58)

This is not my code -- I only put it here for reference to help me solve the USA Today Sudoku puzzles.
